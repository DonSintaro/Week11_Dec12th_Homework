# Week11_Dec12th_Homework


Gathers info from user input using node CLI and creates class objects that can be placed into.  This should generate an HTML page, however....

I feel like there is such a lack of direction or knowledge on this weeks homework assignment.  The template thing has had me go in circles too much.  Does it want us to create templates lits in the app.JS then make a file of engineers, interns, managers?  then combine it all into one html main? Or does it want us to have actual templates in html files then somehow some way duplicate the html into our js, then find a way to dynamically edit those imports on the app.js, then add those to a array full of them, then finally consolidate and write into a new html.  I have to give up on this assignment due to time constraints with job and lack of clear understanding/directions unfortunately.  The way the assignment makes it sound, is a way nothing like my html string literals used for week 9 homework :(  At least my testing is all good.
